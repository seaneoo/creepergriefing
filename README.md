# Creeper Griefing Game Rule

Rather than turning all mob griefing off, you can use the new game rule â€” **creeperGriefing**. When set to `true`, creeper explosions will be normal. When set to `false`, creepers will not do any damage to players or surroundings.

Usage: `/gamerule creeperGriefing <true:false>`

This a server-side only mod, meaning it can be used on Fabric servers (without players needing the mod) or in singleplayer worlds.
